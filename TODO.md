# TODO:

 - parse tablature by line (guitar string)
 - increment by time
 - line stuff up (as a whole)
 - configure order (as a whole)


 # Eventually, support for:

 - 5b || 5^ === bending of a string on the 5th fret
 - 5h7 === hammer from the 5th fret to the 7th fret
 - X or x === muting of a string
 - chord tablature (Am Bm Em) === just parse the letters of the chords
